Mini problems to help students become familiar with JavaScript syntax and idioms

1. Basic Syntax

Log of some thoughts:
* Would be nice if the examples are easy but not mind-numbingly boring
* How should we be mapping this into their world?
      * Is a scratchpad versus ide/graphics output confusing?
* What environment should they be writing in?
      * E.g. in ide, online interpreter, browser scratchpad, etc.
      * Do we have control over what they have access to in that?
